139,1.0,based on the comments i see here and on some of their other videos i feel like i m the only who likes their music   not as much as the videos obviously  but i think the music they make complements and completes the awesome videos  it s like watching a movie  i might not listen to a song off the soundtrack otherwise  but you get more feeling out of a scene when the song playing just feels right for it  that being said i still would listen to their songs by themselves 
140,0.0,https   timebucks com  refid           https   www youtube com watch v vacvqbug s 
141,1.0,okay  first off    yes  they did  in fact  recycle  secondly  laser printers  not ink  thirdly  actually printed  no chromakey or green screen  don t believe me  https   youtu be bfh ilfcirq   especially the scenes when they re doing print tests  i only wish i knew what kind of printers they use  because i want one 
142,-1.0,i love ok go and their videos  but this one is kind of disappointing  all the stop motion in between makes the video look artificial  so probably you wouldn t see any difference if they would have done the paper stuff with cgi  i really loved all the other videos before  especially  upside down   inside out  and also the music itself  but this time it doesn t blow me away like the others  it s not even impressing me at all     i mean a good try but sadly not the level like the last years

152,0.0,ammmmmmmmmmmmmmm  this is white stripse    
153,-1.0,ok    and what about the cost in energy to print all that  and recycle it  and the fact that most recycled paper goes to secondary uses like toilet paper and tissues  ok  so you made something that is extremely wasteful something slightly less wasteful    what a joke 
154,-1.0,oh no  watch out lorax is coming

224,0.0,okay  so i know what kind of paper to buy  but what kind of printer is that 
225,1.0,there are a lot of comments so i don t think the band will see this one  but if anyone on the creative team does i just want to suggest the concept of using     view with a music video  it is a new technology that has not really been used to its full  and i think it would be one of the most groundbreaking things this already legendary band could do  like if you agree

613,0.0,paul dougherty yeah you could do the math for that if every printer screws up one in     times and i had a hundred printers then in theory every time they printed one full wall they would have had a failure  i guess these printers have a much better reliability rate

634,0.0,https   timebucks com  refid           https   www youtube com watch v vacvqbug s 
635,1.0,the irony to me about the career trajectory of ok go is that as their videos get cleverer and cleverer  they get more and more aseptic  ironic because a young damian once said something to the effect that rock and roll is supposed to contain the simple excitement and joy of a kid jumping on a bed  if he just grew his hair back out again and re adopted the guitar power stance and condescended to being sexy brainy instead of just brainy  it would serve them better  that said  we could also definitely use another net neutrality essay from him again

2238,,yes my boys are back
2239,,i mean the song is crappy but the video is nice
2240,,i first discovered ok go by way of their treadmill  rube goldberg machine  and marching band videos about   or   years ago  and i can say with certainty that they ve only gotten better and more creative since then 
2241,,disperdiced paper
2242,,that s amazing  i recently heard that they also have a music band 
2243,,carai que merda em
2244,,i got here from the trending list since bts mic drop is    right now 
2245,,who knew printers could make such a good music video 
2246,,i feel sorry for the people who had to clean up
2247,,so strange  i was just now hoping for an ok go vid   found this trending  nice 
2248,,o yeah  third on trending 
2249,,what a waste of paper 
2250,,these guys should be way more popular

2268,,so  they re running out of ideas 
2269,,in all honesty  even though this band is really talented  their videos are probably half of the reason why they re so popular 
2270,,     office workers gave dislike
2271,,i m confused what is trending now at days     looks  omfg bts      looks down   clicks  wat    is        this

2384,,i wonder how they manage to find time to think about the music part of their videos
2385,,the visuals cant hide the fact the song is garbage  nor thats its a fucking commercial 
2386,,pure geniuses
2387,,wasn t their last music video an advertisement also  i ve loved these guys for years because of their music style and creative vision but if you only make stuff when you re guaranteed a check from a corporation other than your record label sales then that s kind of disingenuous  real  true artists make their creations whether it s paid or not  but now these guys only put out music when it s a guaranteed corporate deal 
2388,,after the initial shock and awe of the effort put into this all i can think about now is  how many paper cuts did they get while making this  
2389,,i hope they recycled all that paper   
2390,,a decent song would have helped
2391,,ok go never fails to keep me satisfied 
2392,,senseless non artistic  modern art  garbage 
2393,,how u define recycle

2496,,how did they coordinate that  wow  that s amazing 
2497,,i suspect they had to create software or something just for the images 
2498,,                                   
2499,,how much paper is in this video 
2500,,ok go is the best thing that s ever happened to music videos  this band is the only exciting thing to come out in the last    years 
2501,,       
2502,,three things about  ok go  that are pretty much a guarantee for me       each time they release a new music video  i m going to enjoy it       i m going to enjoy the song that the music has been put together for       i will be smiling once the music video  and song have ended  due to having enjoyed what i saw and heard  
2503,,oh great another brand deal sell outs

2513,,so    are they funding a terrorist organization 
2514,,i hope they didnt waste all the fuckin paper 
2515,,they donated the paper after the video  didn t you read that in the beginning of the video 
2516,,greenpeace    i hope they get cancer and all die  fcking green terrorists
2517,,fantastic  ever no ordinary video and banal music     awesome group

2524,,incredible
2525,,if i dont get to see a behind the scenes i m going to be dissaapointed
2526,,just got this song on itunes  ur welcome for the dollar 
2527,,i felt like the song amounted to nothing  it was boring  the trick with printers just seemed excessive and indulgent without saying anything   i want to like ok go because they have been innovative and enjoyable to listen to  but anymore  their songs are inconsequential paired with the budget of a studio that just wants more gimmicks and more viral videos 
2528,,this band has the best videos
2529,,a ideia foi legal mas a m sica   chatinha  j  foram mais inovadores   
2530,,all these other band rival eachother and produce so fast  like facebook  buy ok go takes their time and produces slower but better  like youtube  okgo has no rivals  they re in own category  a god category 
2531,,they ve been my favorite band since i was       years later they still are  best video band on the internet  no competition
2532,,feel like this was an great ad for printers
2533,,i like cheeseburgers way too much

2872,,you know its real because of all the paper jams  lol
2873,,rambosantoni but it didn t jam at all  whatchu mean 
2874,,               
2875,,nice video but i dont like the song  imo ofc 
2876,,kings of music vids
2877,,this is the first time ive seen one of their videos  wow they are so creative  hps stock went up a ton right before the creation of this video   
2878,,yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
2879,,music video of the year

2882,,               
2883,,            
2884,,fantastic work 
2885,,bts is better mic drop remix should be on trending       but this is good too   
2886,,the best double a paper advertisement so far 
2887,,now i can t stop thinking about lupisvulpes 
2888,,this should ve been the ad for dunder mifflin 
2889,,beautiful video as always   you guys so amazing  
2890,,stop arguing about how they  wasted  ink and or paper  i could argue many valid points about this topic  but you all seem to know how to type coherent sentences  so you should know how to appreciate artistic videos  at least it s not jake paul or ricegum or any other shit on youtube  this is what youtube was made for  hard work and effort put into videos  so if you guys have a problem with this  that s fine  but just know how much work was put into this as well 
2891,,they really do have an obsession of crazy amazing music videos 
2892,,i would say thanks again for thinking outside of the box   but i would bet your mental version of a box looks way cooler than mine  you fine gentleman are true treasures 
2893,,wow guy hits school bus gory youtube com watch v un vxp qrw 
2894,,leave it to ok go to produce yet another show stopper   only they can turn something as simple as treadmills and printers into something amazing 
2895,,obsessed with using a ton of paper  a very ambitious art installation 
2896,,y all crazy    crazy awesome 
2897,,fun fact  recycling paper can actually worse for the environment due to not only shipping and delivering the paper to the facility  but also puts pollutants into the environment  not only that  less trees are planted as a result of recycling 
2898,,been a fan since  this too shall pass  so cool to see their style evolve over time   
2899,,i really don t understand why people would be upset by the amount of paper they used    think about it  for other music videos  they fly and ship entire bands and equipment around  or they even use purpose built stages using tons of metal  wood etc      ok go just used a few pounds of paper  every frame they use about     sheets of paper  that is like throwing away a tiny piece of wood which really is no big deal 
2900,,https   youtu be cttirqtm f

3331,,i wonder how many paper jams happened
3332,,these videos are amazing  i wonder how many times they had to do this to get it all right
3333,,must be cgi because there is no way they got that many printers working and choreographed so well without a techie going postal
3334,,the concept is ridiculous  another sad way to push to consumption and wastage  i don t support at all

3344,,i wantmake dis  howto 
3345,,soo good   
3346,,that what i call it art
3347,,given the amount of ink involved and the relatively low amount of fiber in printer paper  it d have been better for the planet to just discard the leftovers   recycling inky paper necessitates the production of a lot of chemicals   interesting that proceeds from this production were donated to greenpeace  because that organisation s hard line on recycling at all costs is what led one of its founders to part ways with them  there s a clip wherein the guy talks about this around somewhere  but he said basically what i repeated above  farming trees for new paper is a more ecologically sound method than recycling certain kinds of consumer paper waste

3707,,the best videoclips
3708,,omg yes  this is my favorite of your songs i m so glad you made a video for it
3709,,i dont think andy has ever looked like he s having a good time in any videos
3710,,nooooo        tree            
3711,,frickin    great   
3712,,oh    so it s a marketing ploy  not a genuine artistic take on the music    got it    
3713,,the funding has to come from somewhere  this stuff is expensive as hell 
3714,,great video and imagination  btw  i have a seizure disorder and was not affected by the video  keep imagining 
3715,,                                                                                        
3716,,i don t really like the song but holy shit that s a lot of paper  i m not surprised if you used more than   million paper 
3717,,                                      
3718,,looks like they took the time and coordination we usually see from these guys  but this does not resonate with me   seems disjointed  and juvenile compared to other masterpieces they have made   also damian s voice has never been strong  seen him in live shows etc  here it also seems flat which is not a good look   disappointing  but maybe i am missing what they are going for     maybe its all  d chess or something      
3719,,are you fucking kidding me
3720,,omg  yessss 
3721,,i m guessing all these likes are for the video itself  since the music is just pure trash 
3722,,there are plenty of people who actually like it  music is subjective

3818,,i just binge watched all your videos last night with my boyfriend going on and on about how you are the coolest band and then you release this  o   i am in awe    
3819,,this is the first music vid i ever saw of ok go when they released it   d
3820,,god  i loved it   the sound of all the paper falling out of the printers was so satisfying and i m so glad it was all recycled after  ok go never disappoints in creativity
3821,,kids in africa could have eaten that paper 
3822,,     freeze frame           o
3823,,genius    as always 
3824,,                                                                                                                    
3825,,im like  this is just waste  and  its an amazing idea wow  at the same time   
3826,,could have just used cgi   but they had to turn this into an advertisement for printer paper lol
3827,,cgi would be boring and potentially more costly  they need funding  so they go to advertisers  if a video is sponsored it doesn t automatically mean that the video is an ad 
3828,,this is  amazing  as expected  but i feel that it didn t end up as incredibly perfect as the one moment  or upside down   inside out  also  the choreography is  imho  one of the least inventive of ok go so far  could it be trish sie missing  guessing here   if it were not about obsession  maybe my ocd wouldn t be triggered and  even though i would notice the same  i wouldn t feel compelled to write this  now i will anxiously wait for the making of video   
3829,,                                        
3830,,onikorp

3851,,

4157,,a o smith the papers weren t stuck  they were out of sync and one frame ahead 
4158,,two things i want to know     how did you change the printer drivers so that they kept hold of the paper   please do a bts video about this      how many papercuts did the cleanup give you all 
4159,,here at  k views
4160,,okay  i haven t watched this yet  but i ve been watching a lot of your videos on repeat for around a week now  this is a spectacular treat   edit  video has been watched  and is still a spectacular treat  thank you for making it 
4161,,cool
4162,,love this   great to read about the paper being reycled but would ve liked to see a few choice pages given  or auctioned  to fans    
4163,,i m sure they kept a few for that specific purpose  they generally keep a few pieces from each of their videos 
4164,,here we go again    oh wait no it isn t  p
4165,,cool  
4166,,here they come up another innovative and awesome video     ok go   
4167,, oh it s okay if it s recycled  fuck no  ok it consumes less energy and ressources but it still consumes  the inks used too   so nice waste    
4168,,i love how you think the paper is unusable after this    you should know an average office space uses this much paper super quickly  too  but we don t see you triggered over that   stop being so triggered on your high horse  while you re probably browsing this video on your mac or some shit 
4169,,                                                               wont let you down

4745,1.0,i thoroughly enjoyed watching this royal wedding it was a very welcome event in light of the constant flood of bad news in todays world everything was perfect  the weather for a change blue skies in the uk the church choir singing the live orchestra music the chello solo performance the theatrical passionate and inspiring speech given by that pastor would have loved to know what was going through the queens mind while she listen to his sermon since they say that she dislikes long sermons and above all that ethereal rendition of stand by me by that black choirmeghans mom looked a bit sad if i had to guess why it would be because she has to reckon with the reality that her daughter has to move to live in the uk
4746,1.0,i loved loved this wedding the songs the preaching the prayers the love and giggling the married couple displayed they are very beautiful the dress was simple yet stunning the bride was amazingly beautiful i actually watched it many timesbut i am     i hope this was really love blooming and not just lust or still the honeymoon phase of the falling in love feeling i hope meghan is not a covert narcissist and that all this was not acting from her part harry seemed truly in love meghan it also looked like deep love just that i hope it was genuine not acting her past  displayed vicious narcissistic traits in so many ways knowing that narcissists are so perfect in faking they can pretty much fool everyone the victims get to realize who they really are only too late after they have turned cold on them narcissist actress high position like this one in which narcissitic supplies will flow abundantly for a good while is a dangerous toxic combination for the potential victim who might never recover from the narcissistic bond created by the perfect love bomber i just hope for harry that he did not fall into a well prep trap hope all the shady side of meghan past was just an exaggerationi wish them love and happiness in case this is true genuine love
